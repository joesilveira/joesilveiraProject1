# joesilveiraProject1
Project 1 of Senior Design and Development

This project allows for the program to ping the "jobs.github.com" API and return all of the jobs listed in on the api.
The program compiles the list of job "Titles" and prints them out to a file the user specifies.

To change the api or file:

In the handler class edit the variable 'url' or 'filePath'

**I could not figure out how to add the github actions script to my build.gradle file**

**I also have two tests that I could not figure out how to add to the gradle build file**
If you run the APItests they work as they should, I just cant figure out how to appropriately add them to 
the gradle build.
