# joesilveiraProject1
Project 1 of Senior Design and Development

This project allows for the program to ping the "jobs.github.com" API and return all of the jobs listed in on the api.
The program compiles the list of job "Titles" and prints them out to a file the user specifies.

To change the api or file:

In the main class edit the variable 'url' or 'filePath'
