Dit verwachten we van je
Met vragen over iOS, WatchOS en tvOS kunnen we bij jou terecht.
Tenminste één programmeertaal heeft geen geheimen meer voor je.

Werken bij Egeniq is werken in een fijne sfeer met mensen die jouw passie delen. Vol toffe wearables en gadgets. En digitale nomaden die toch als een team samenwerken. Wie wil dat nou niet?
Sta jij op met Android en is jouw dag niet geslaagd als je niet minstens een keer kon lachen om iets wat je kan verbeteren met een Android app? Dan denken we daar alvast hetzelfde over.
We werken op afstand, wat betekent dat de meesten van ons vanuit huis werken. Ook hebben sommige van onze klanten iemand nodig die gedurende 1 of 2 dagen per sprint of per week ter plaatse is. Dit is een ideale combinatie voor flexibele werkuren maar toch voldoende interactie met de klant.
Dit ben jij
Je bent software engineer en geen programmeur. Je begrijpt waarom dit een belangrijk verschil is.
Je deelt graag jouw kennis. En leert graag van anderen.
Je maakt gave dingen waar je trots op bent.
Dit kun je bij ons
Jij maakt het verschil met de apps die je bij ons maakt.
Elke dag leer je er wat bij.
Je werkt op de plek waar jij je het prettigst voelt.
Je werkt met de Gadget Kit: MacBook Pro, 27” 5k Display en alle devices die je nodig hebt voor de apps die je gaat maken.
Dit verwachten we van je
Met vragen over Android kunnen we bij jou terecht.
Tenminste één programmeertaal heeft geen geheimen meer voor je.
Je hebt een opleiding voltooid op het gebied van IT of Computerwetenschappen.
Je bent getalenteerd en gepassioneerd. Vooral voor programmeren. Dat laat je ook zien.
Herken je jezelf in deze vacature?
Neem dan even contact met ons op. Stuur ons je CV en motivatie via de link, dan komen we snel op je sollicitatie terug.
Acquisitie naar aanleiding van deze vacature wordt niet op prijs gesteld.

   Job Title: RFP: JavaScript component for embedding a list of Podcast Episodes  in Website Builders with specific functionality for Wordpress 
   Job Description: RFP: JavaScript component for embedding a list of Podcast Episodes
in Website Builders with specific functionality for Wordpress
The goal of this project is to repurpose our JavaScript components currently available
for Weebly, to allow users on the Wordpress platform to embed their podcast episodes
and information on their own custom webpages.
Recent episode player:
This will always display the latest episode published by a user. It includes playback,
timeline bar, description, title and mute buttons.
Podcast Info:
Basic information about the user’s podcast including Category, Genre, Location,
Followers.
Episode Grid:
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a grid format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as transparency vs white bar background for episode titles
(See mockups below)
Episode List
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a List format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as displaying the episode thumbnail image or not. (See
mockups below)
All components must adapt their font style (Title, body, caption) and color to the
webpage theme the user has. All components must offer a color player and a gray
player version, background opacity color, and must be responsive to mobile and
desktop)
Examples of the current plugins in Weebly:
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
Requirements for the embeddable component:
The component should be pure JavaScript, i.e. not an embeddable iframe, and
be enabled either via data attributes or a JavaScript call. i..e the html might look
something like:
The component should make use of Podomatic’s API which uses JSON over REST. A
sample response looks like this:
https://api.podomatic.com/v2/podcasts/5133407/episodes?podcast=true
The following attributes should be customizable:
? The style (grid or list)
? Number of items per page
?
The color scheme (currently light or dark)
?
Whether background images are displayed or not
The component will be styled mostly by the choice of style and color scheme
however it should be possible to override the styles from a global style sheet.
Additionally the layout should be responsive.
The component should load new pages using an infinite scrolling mechanism.
Requirements for the Wordpress plugin integration:
As part of our strategy we also want the above component to be made available
as a Wordpress plugin. To keep the look and feel of the application consistent
this should use the JavaScript file created above. It should also provide the
same level of customizability.
Additional notes
All resulting code and assets will belong to Podomatic. The embeddable code
will be hosted on our own CDN and the Wordpress Plugin on their infrastructure.
Please provide specific instructions on how you would go about building and what in your experience would be useful or relevant to the project.  Also include either a resume or gitbub. Thank you,

In een samenleving waarin informatie explosief toeneemt, is het vrij kunnen beschikken over betrouwbare en integrale data cruciaal.

Daarmee voedt het CBS het maatschappelijk debat, de beleidsontwikkeling en de besluitvorming en draagt zo bij aan welvaart, welzijn en democratie.
Het CBS werd in 1899 opgericht vanuit de behoefte aan onafhankelijke, betrouwbare informatie om maatschappelijke vraagstukken te begrijpen. Deze rol heeft het CBS nog altijd. De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologieën en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.
Wat ga je doen?
Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies díe informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft. Dit doen we door een computergestuurde dialoog, zo menselijk mogelijk, te ontwikkelen die alle informatie die nu in onze open data database beschikbaar is aan te bieden. We zijn het eerste statistiekbureau in de wereld dat deze uitdaging aangaat.

   Job Title: Senior PHP/Laravel Developer: Your Dream Work Environment
   Job Description: Attention Senior Backend Developers:
“Skyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment – While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase”
You’ve finally found it…
The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.
If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!
But only if you keep reading.
iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.
On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.
Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.
To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.
8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School
Solve Interesting Problems
Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.
This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.
up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.
The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.
Work With A Clean Codebase
Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”
We don’t work like that.
kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.
term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.
Endless Opportunities To Grow
You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.
We get how important growth is for developers.
Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.
Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.
Get Expert Guidance
Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.
If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.
Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.
Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.
Stay In Control Over Your Own Time
Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?
You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.
We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.
This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.
Work From Anywhere In The World
We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!
long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.
Stability You Can Count On
and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.
Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.
You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.
Millions Of People Will Use Your Code
Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.
During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.

Stiamo portando meritocrazia e trasparenza in un mercato finora opaco; vogliamo trasformare sia il modo in cui gli italiani scelgono un professionista sia quello in cui i professionisti trovano clienti.
Siamo una startup in grandissima crescita: a marzo 2015 eravamo 2 persone, oggi siamo più di 100. 29 anni è l'età media, lavoriamo in open space, e riduciamo al minimo la burocrazia (perchè è semplicemente controproducente), ognuno ha grandi responsabilità e impatta direttamente sul nostro successo.
Abbiamo investitori istituzionali del calibro di Immobiliare.it, e angel investor di alto profilo, che lavorano in Google, Facebook, eBay, McKinsey e Unicredit: non abbiamo più i rischi tipici di una startup. Nel 2017 abbiamo avviato il processo di internazionalizzazione conquistando anche il mercato di Austria e Svizzera, e non é finita qua...
Cerchiamo persone che vogliano costruire un colosso nel mondo del digital italiano che impatti fortemente la vita di tutti noi. Non è un lavoro tranquillo – ci mettiamo il cuore.
IL TUO RUOLO
ProntoPro cambierà il modo in cui i clienti trovano i professionisti. Avrai piena visibilità sul business, non solo sulla tua area.

Sarai parte del team Technology, oggi composto da 15 (+) persone e che arriverà a 25 entro fine 2018.

Stiamo cercando un Software Engineer che voglia unirsi al nostro team Technology.
Ci aspettiamo che tu abbia una solida esperienza in:
Javascript, CSS, SASS, SCSS, manipolazione DOM e JS object model
Scrivere codice pulito, mantenibile, scalabile e aderente ai principi SOLID
Assicurare test coverage del codice prodotto
Astrarre il codice prodotto costruendo componenti e librerie riutilizzabili

Utilizzare (e quando necessario creare da zero) client e librerie per consumare servizi REST

You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here’s how one day might unfold:
one.
10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.
12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.
12:30 Travel to Stride

6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I’ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it’s been a huge career learning experience for me.
6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.

   Job Title: RFP: JavaScript component for embedding a list of Podcast Episodes  in Website Builders with specific functionality for Wordpress 
   Job Description: RFP: JavaScript component for embedding a list of Podcast Episodes
in Website Builders with specific functionality for Wordpress
The goal of this project is to repurpose our JavaScript components currently available
for Weebly, to allow users on the Wordpress platform to embed their podcast episodes
and information on their own custom webpages.
Recent episode player:
This will always display the latest episode published by a user. It includes playback,
timeline bar, description, title and mute buttons.
Podcast Info:
Basic information about the user’s podcast including Category, Genre, Location,
Followers.
Episode Grid:
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a grid format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as transparency vs white bar background for episode titles
(See mockups below)
Episode List
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a List format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as displaying the episode thumbnail image or not. (See
mockups below)
All components must adapt their font style (Title, body, caption) and color to the
webpage theme the user has. All components must offer a color player and a gray
player version, background opacity color, and must be responsive to mobile and
desktop)
Examples of the current plugins in Weebly:
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
Requirements for the embeddable component:
The component should be pure JavaScript, i.e. not an embeddable iframe, and
be enabled either via data attributes or a JavaScript call. i..e the html might look
something like:
The component should make use of Podomatic’s API which uses JSON over REST. A
sample response looks like this:
https://api.podomatic.com/v2/podcasts/5133407/episodes?podcast=true
The following attributes should be customizable:
? The style (grid or list)
? Number of items per page
?
The color scheme (currently light or dark)
?
Whether background images are displayed or not
The component will be styled mostly by the choice of style and color scheme
however it should be possible to override the styles from a global style sheet.
Additionally the layout should be responsive.
The component should load new pages using an infinite scrolling mechanism.
Requirements for the Wordpress plugin integration:
As part of our strategy we also want the above component to be made available
as a Wordpress plugin. To keep the look and feel of the application consistent
this should use the JavaScript file created above. It should also provide the
same level of customizability.
Additional notes
All resulting code and assets will belong to Podomatic. The embeddable code
will be hosted on our own CDN and the Wordpress Plugin on their infrastructure.
Please provide specific instructions on how you would go about building and what in your experience would be useful or relevant to the project.  Also include either a resume or gitbub. Thank you,

   Job Description: Software Engineer Information Dialogue
Standplaats: Den Haag
Breng jij bij het CBS AI tot leven?
Over het CBS
In een samenleving waarin informatie explosief toeneemt, is het vrij kunnen beschikken over betrouwbare en integrale data cruciaal. Het CBS levert als hét statistische bureau van Nederland met betrouwbare statistische informatie en data inzicht in maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Daarmee voedt het CBS het maatschappelijk debat, de beleidsontwikkeling en de besluitvorming en draagt zo bij aan welvaart, welzijn en democratie.
Het CBS werd in 1899 opgericht vanuit de behoefte aan onafhankelijke, betrouwbare informatie om maatschappelijke vraagstukken te begrijpen. Deze rol heeft het CBS nog altijd. De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologieën en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.
Wat ga je doen?
Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies díe informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft. Dit doen we door een computergestuurde dialoog, zo menselijk mogelijk, te ontwikkelen die alle informatie die nu in onze open data database beschikbaar is aan te bieden. We zijn het eerste statistiekbureau in de wereld dat deze uitdaging aangaat.
Je gaat de software ontwikkelen die de verbinding maakt tussen deze open data en de spraakrobot (bijvoorbeeld Google Assistant).

   Job Description: Attention Senior Backend Developers:
“Skyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment – While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase”
You’ve finally found it…
The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.
If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!
But only if you keep reading.
iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.
On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.
Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.
To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.
8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School
Solve Interesting Problems
Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.
This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.
up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.
The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.
Work With A Clean Codebase
Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”
We don’t work like that.
kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.
term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.
Endless Opportunities To Grow
You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.
We get how important growth is for developers.
Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.
Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.
Get Expert Guidance
Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.
If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.
Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.
Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.
Stay In Control Over Your Own Time
Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?

Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks.

We’re looking for somebody who has worked in web development before, but you don't need to have specific experience with our tooling or choice of frameworks. We’re happy to show you how our stack works.

6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy.

   Job Title: RFP: JavaScript component for embedding a list of Podcast Episodes  in Website Builders with specific functionality for Wordpress 
   Job Description: RFP: JavaScript component for embedding a list of Podcast Episodes
in Website Builders with specific functionality for Wordpress
The goal of this project is to repurpose our JavaScript components currently available
for Weebly, to allow users on the Wordpress platform to embed their podcast episodes
and information on their own custom webpages.
Recent episode player:
This will always display the latest episode published by a user. It includes playback,
timeline bar, description, title and mute buttons.
Podcast Info:
Basic information about the user’s podcast including Category, Genre, Location,
Followers.
Episode Grid:
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a grid format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as transparency vs white bar background for episode titles
(See mockups below)
Episode List
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a List format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as displaying the episode thumbnail image or not. (See
mockups below)
All components must adapt their font style (Title, body, caption) and color to the
webpage theme the user has. All components must offer a color player and a gray
player version, background opacity color, and must be responsive to mobile and
desktop)
Examples of the current plugins in Weebly:
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
Requirements for the embeddable component:
The component should be pure JavaScript, i.e. not an embeddable iframe, and
be enabled either via data attributes or a JavaScript call. i..e the html might look
something like:
The component should make use of Podomatic’s API which uses JSON over REST. A
sample response looks like this:
https://api.podomatic.com/v2/podcasts/5133407/episodes?podcast=true
The following attributes should be customizable:
? The style (grid or list)
? Number of items per page
?
The color scheme (currently light or dark)
?
Whether background images are displayed or not
The component will be styled mostly by the choice of style and color scheme
however it should be possible to override the styles from a global style sheet.
Additionally the layout should be responsive.
The component should load new pages using an infinite scrolling mechanism.
Requirements for the Wordpress plugin integration:
As part of our strategy we also want the above component to be made available
as a Wordpress plugin. To keep the look and feel of the application consistent
this should use the JavaScript file created above. It should also provide the
same level of customizability.
Additional notes
All resulting code and assets will belong to Podomatic. The embeddable code
will be hosted on our own CDN and the Wordpress Plugin on their infrastructure.
Please provide specific instructions on how you would go about building and what in your experience would be useful or relevant to the project.  Also include either a resume or gitbub. Thank you,

In een samenleving waarin informatie explosief toeneemt, is het vrij kunnen beschikken over betrouwbare en integrale data cruciaal.

Daarmee voedt het CBS het maatschappelijk debat, de beleidsontwikkeling en de besluitvorming en draagt zo bij aan welvaart, welzijn en democratie.
Het CBS werd in 1899 opgericht vanuit de behoefte aan onafhankelijke, betrouwbare informatie om maatschappelijke vraagstukken te begrijpen. Deze rol heeft het CBS nog altijd. De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologieën en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.
Wat ga je doen?
Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies díe informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft. Dit doen we door een computergestuurde dialoog, zo menselijk mogelijk, te ontwikkelen die alle informatie die nu in onze open data database beschikbaar is aan te bieden. We zijn het eerste statistiekbureau in de wereld dat deze uitdaging aangaat.

You’ve finally found it…
The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.
If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!
But only if you keep reading.
iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.
On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.
Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.
To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.
8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School
Solve Interesting Problems
Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.
This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.
up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.
The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.
Work With A Clean Codebase
Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”
We don’t work like that.
kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.
term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.
Endless Opportunities To Grow
You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.
We get how important growth is for developers.
Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.
Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.
Get Expert Guidance
Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.
If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.
Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.
Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.
Stay In Control Over Your Own Time
Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?
You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.
We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.
This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.
Work From Anywhere In The World
We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!

Stability You Can Count On

Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.
You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.
Millions Of People Will Use Your Code
Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.

one.
10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.
12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.

6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I’ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it’s been a huge career learning experience for me.

Werken bij Egeniq is werken in een fijne sfeer met mensen die jouw passie delen. Vol toffe wearables en gadgets. En digitale nomaden die toch als een team samenwerken. Wie wil dat nou niet?

Je maakt gave dingen waar je trots op bent.

   Job Title: RFP: JavaScript component for embedding a list of Podcast Episodes  in Website Builders with specific functionality for Wordpress 
   Job Description: RFP: JavaScript component for embedding a list of Podcast Episodes
in Website Builders with specific functionality for Wordpress
The goal of this project is to repurpose our JavaScript components currently available
for Weebly, to allow users on the Wordpress platform to embed their podcast episodes
and information on their own custom webpages.
Recent episode player:
This will always display the latest episode published by a user. It includes playback,
timeline bar, description, title and mute buttons.
Podcast Info:
Basic information about the user’s podcast including Category, Genre, Location,
Followers.
Episode Grid:
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a grid format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as transparency vs white bar background for episode titles
(See mockups below)
Episode List
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a List format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as displaying the episode thumbnail image or not. (See
mockups below)
All components must adapt their font style (Title, body, caption) and color to the
webpage theme the user has. All components must offer a color player and a gray
player version, background opacity color, and must be responsive to mobile and
desktop)
Examples of the current plugins in Weebly:
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
theme.podomatic.net/
Requirements for the embeddable component:
The component should be pure JavaScript, i.e. not an embeddable iframe, and
be enabled either via data attributes or a JavaScript call. i..e the html might look
something like:
The component should make use of Podomatic’s API which uses JSON over REST. A
sample response looks like this:
https://api.podomatic.com/v2/podcasts/5133407/episodes?podcast=true
The following attributes should be customizable:
? The style (grid or list)
? Number of items per page
?
The color scheme (currently light or dark)
?
Whether background images are displayed or not
The component will be styled mostly by the choice of style and color scheme
however it should be possible to override the styles from a global style sheet.
Additionally the layout should be responsive.
The component should load new pages using an infinite scrolling mechanism.
Requirements for the Wordpress plugin integration:
As part of our strategy we also want the above component to be made available
as a Wordpress plugin. To keep the look and feel of the application consistent
this should use the JavaScript file created above. It should also provide the
same level of customizability.
Additional notes
All resulting code and assets will belong to Podomatic. The embeddable code
will be hosted on our own CDN and the Wordpress Plugin on their infrastructure.
Please provide specific instructions on how you would go about building and what in your experience would be useful or relevant to the project.  Also include either a resume or gitbub. Thank you,

In een samenleving waarin informatie explosief toeneemt, is het vrij kunnen beschikken over betrouwbare en integrale data cruciaal.

Daarmee voedt het CBS het maatschappelijk debat, de beleidsontwikkeling en de besluitvorming en draagt zo bij aan welvaart, welzijn en democratie.
Het CBS werd in 1899 opgericht vanuit de behoefte aan onafhankelijke, betrouwbare informatie om maatschappelijke vraagstukken te begrijpen. Deze rol heeft het CBS nog altijd. De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologieën en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.
Wat ga je doen?
Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies díe informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft. Dit doen we door een computergestuurde dialoog, zo menselijk mogelijk, te ontwikkelen die alle informatie die nu in onze open data database beschikbaar is aan te bieden. We zijn het eerste statistiekbureau in de wereld dat deze uitdaging aangaat.

   Job Title: Senior PHP/Laravel Developer: Your Dream Work Environment
   Job Description: Attention Senior Backend Developers:
“Skyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment – While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase”
You’ve finally found it…
The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.
If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!
But only if you keep reading.
iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.
On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.
Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.
To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.
8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School
Solve Interesting Problems
Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.
This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.
up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.
The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.
Work With A Clean Codebase
Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”
We don’t work like that.
kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.
term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.
Endless Opportunities To Grow
You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.
We get how important growth is for developers.
Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.
Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.
Get Expert Guidance
Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.
If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.
Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.
Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.
Stay In Control Over Your Own Time
Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?
You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.
We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.
This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.
Work From Anywhere In The World
We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!
long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.
Stability You Can Count On
and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.
Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.
You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.
Millions Of People Will Use Your Code
Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.
During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.

On the technical side, most of the work we’re doing is front end development work in JavaScript/ES6, D3.js, Bootstrap and Svelte. There’s a PHP and MySQL backend as well, but that won’t be too much of your concern.
We’re looking for somebody who has worked in web development before, but you don't need to have specific experience with our tooling or choice of frameworks. We’re happy to show you how our stack works.

A significant part of the job will involve interacting with users and customers. be it by phone, video call or email. We encourage everybody in our company to do this, but in this role it will be particularly prevalent
That means we're looking for someone with good communication, interpersonal and written skills.

You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here’s how one day might unfold:
one.
10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.
12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.
12:30 Travel to Stride

6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I’ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it’s been a huge career learning experience for me.
6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.
